When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

Depends. If I don't have to share the my work with anyone, I will keep it locally.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If the changes urgent or important, it might works, but if someone makes small changes often, it will be really annoying.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Copy repository within local repository or remote to local (or vice versa) is cloning. Copy repository within remote is forking. Making a branch from existing commit is branching.

I would use
1) branching for add or fixing for existing products.
2) cloning for start the local repository
3) forking for copying existing GitHub repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can solve the possible conflict locally (though it is not up-to-date).

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?
